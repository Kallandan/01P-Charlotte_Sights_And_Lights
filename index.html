    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
    <p>Charlotte is a gateway to the American South and a great introduction to the culture and turbulent history of the
      region.
      Though previously known as a business centre, the tourism industry has brought some great attractions and tours to
      the city.
      Charlotte looks like a brand new city, but there’s a lot of history here. Its roots run deep in the Old South, way
      back before
      the American Revolution. Today, it is one of America’s largest banking centers and one of the nation’s
      fastest-growing metropolitan
      areas. Newcomers roll in daily from across the United States and around the globe. There’s a sense of possibility
      and of change so
      strong that it’s energizing—and magnetic. Charlotte is a place that asks you to dig in, to find connections and to
      make history here yourself.</p>
